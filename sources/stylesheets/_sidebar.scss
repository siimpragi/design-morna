/* SIDEBAR */
// Styling rules for the site's sidebar. These rules affect the entire site.

// NB! Sidebar is not the part of the current template by default, but it can be easily included:
// 1. Add "sidebar" component to the site's template components folder.
// 2. Include the component into the appropriate place (or places) in the layout.
// 3. Uncomment the "_sidebar.scss" partial in the "main.scss" file.
// 4. Add the styling rules for the generated component.
